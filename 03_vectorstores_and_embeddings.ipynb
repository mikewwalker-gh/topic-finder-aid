I\\'m glad to hear this \\nmachine learning stuff was actually useful. So what was it that you learned? Was it \\nlogistic regression? Was it the PCA? Was it the data ne tworks? What was it that you \\nlearned that was so helpful?\" And the student said, \"Oh, it was the MATLAB.\"  \\nSo for those of you that don\\'t know MATLAB yet, I hope you do learn it. It\\'s not hard, \\nand we\\'ll actually have a short MATLAB tutori al in one of the discussion sections for \\nthose of you that don\\'t know it.  \\nOkay. The very last piece of logistical th ing is the discussion s ections. So discussion \\nsections will be taught by the TAs, and atte ndance at discussion sections is optional, \\nalthough they\\'ll also be recorded and televi sed. And we\\'ll use the discussion sections \\nmainly for two things. For the next two or th ree weeks, we\\'ll use the discussion sections \\nto go over the prerequisites to this class or if some of you haven\\'t seen probability or \\nstatistics for a while or maybe algebra, we\\'ll go over those in the discussion sections as a \\nrefresher for those of you that want one.', metadata={'page': 8, 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/machinelearning-lecture01.pdf'})"

So one thi ng that I think will help you to succeed and \\ndo well in this class and even help you to enjoy this cla ss more is if you form a study \\ngroup.  \\nSo start looking around where you' re sitting now or at the end of class today, mingle a \\nlittle bit and get to know your classmates. I strongly encourage you to form study groups \\nand sort of have a group of people to study with and have a group of your fellow students \\nto talk over these concepts with. You can also  post on the class news group if you want to \\nuse that to try to form a study group.  \\nBut some of the problems sets in this cla ss are reasonably difficult.  People that have \\ntaken the class before may tell you they were very difficult.

So homework \\nassignments, homework solutions will be posted online at the course home page.  \\nAs far as this class, I've also written, a nd I guess I've also revised every year a set of \\nfairly detailed lecture notes that cover the te chnical content of this  class. And so if you \\nvisit the course homepage, you'll also find the detailed lecture notes that go over in detail \\nall the math and equations and so on  that I'll be doing in class.  \\nThere's also a newsgroup, su.class.cs229, also written on the handout. This is a \\nnewsgroup that's sort of a forum for people in  the class to get to  know each other and \\nhave whatever discussions you want to ha ve amongst yourselves.
